            <h1>Why work on campus?</h1>
            <h2>Real-world experience</h2>
            <p>
              There are many reasons to work on campus as a student. Working on
              campus helps students connect with students, faculty, and staff
              that might be outside of their field of study. Learning how to
              balance a work life with school is a very valuable tool that many
              students here learn. Campus jobs can help students build
              portfolios and work skills to help them find jobs and succeed
              after graduation.
            </p>
            <h2>Flexibility</h2>
            <p>
              Most university jobs have built-in flexibility, with the
              understanding that studies come first. Creating a schedule that
              allows students to have time to study is easy with a campus job.
              Most jobs are also close to or on campus, making transportation
              simple.

            <h2>Connect with the classroom: Iowa GROW&reg;</h2>
            <p>
              Iowa GROW is our way of helping students connect what they learn
              in the classroom to experiences at work. Iowa GROW (Guided
              Reflection on Work) focuses on making student employment a
              "high-impact activity." Talking with a supervisor helps students
              connect the skills and knowledge that you as a student are gaining
              in the classroom with the work that you are doing, and vice versa.
              While work is a great place to learn "real world" work skills,
              such as time management, conflict resolution, and balancing
              priorities it can help to talk over the less obvious skills you
              are learning with your supervisor in order to make the most out of
              your education and your job.

                “Working as a student employee has had an incredible impact on
                my college experience. For one, it helped me find my passion and
                helped me get on track for my future. As with most students, I
                was completely unsure of what I was planning to study and
                eventually pursue as a career. Working as a personal trainer
                helped me find my love for fitness and really helped me direct
                my studies and future toward my passion.”
