    <h1>Working on Campus</h1>
    <h2>Real-world experience</h2>
    <p>
      There are many reasons to work on campus as a student. Working on campus
      helps students connect with students, faculty, and staff that might be
      outside of their field of study. Learning how to balance a work life with
      school is a very valuable tool that many students here learn. Campus jobs
      can help students build portfolios and work skills to help them find jobs
      and succeed after graduation.
    </p>
    <h2>Flexibility</h2>
    <p>
      Most university jobs have built-in flexibility, with the understanding
      that studies come first. Creating a schedule that allows students to have
      time to study is easy with a campus job. Most jobs are also close to or on
      campus, making transportation simple.

    <h2>Connect with the classroom: Iowa GROW&reg;</h2>
    <p>
      Iowa GROW is our way of helping students connect what they learn in the
      classroom to experiences at work. Iowa GROW (Guided Reflection on Work)
      focuses on making student employment a "high-impact activity." Talking
      with a supervisor helps students connect the skills and knowledge that you
      as a student are gaining in the classroom with the work that you are
      doing, and vice versa. While work is a great place to learn "real world"
      work skills, such as time management, conflict resolution, and balancing
      priorities it can help to talk over the less obvious skills you are
      learning with your supervisor in order to make the most out of your
      education and your job.

    <h2>Testimonials</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        “Working as a student employee has had an incredible impact on my
        college experience. For one, it helped me find my passion and helped me
        get on track for my future. As with most students, I was completely
        unsure of what I was planning to study and eventually pursue as a
        career. Working as a personal trainer helped me find my love for fitness
        and really helped me direct my studies and future toward my passion.”
